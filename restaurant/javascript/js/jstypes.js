// JavaScript defines seven built-in types, one object and six primitives. Now object type is a collection of name value pairs. 
// It is nothing more than that in JavaScript. A primitive type can only contain a single, immutable value. And remember thar immutable 
// means that once you set it, it cannot be changed. You could create new values based on this values, but you cannot change the original value anymore.
