<p class="green"> <b>The Indefinite Article</b>
The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a noun that begins with a consonant. 
It’s an when it precedes a noun that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a noun doesn’t refer to a particular thing.
 For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a
 specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that 
 she is not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns</p>
 <p><b>Article Before an Adjective</b>
Sometimes an article modifies a noun that is also modified by an adjective. The usual word order is article + adjective + noun.
 If the article is indefinite, choose a or an 
based on the word that immediately follows it.</p>
